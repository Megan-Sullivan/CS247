// <script src="app.js"></script> Try Changing "app.js" To "evilapp.js" For A Good Laugh

// evilapp.js Information
// The following code is pretty much copy pasted from Copilot (Bing AI), I decided to leave it this way on this version of my app.js aka it's evil counterpart evilapp.js 
// so comparisons can be made to see everything I changed from this and make sure
// I fully comprehend what the code is doing, of course there are things within this I came up with on my own mostly finding the ideal wario image, 
// I had to convert a .mp4 to a .mp3 file, and work with ai to get it to generate the code so it finally looked the way I wanted, it was not quick and easy,
// I probably spent 3 hours on this easy and just for funsies pretty much, I hope you enjoy it :D

// app.js Information
// I completely revised the comments so they are very in depth and easy to understand, I also added the code snippets from the original html file that needed to be recreated piece by piece as comments above the DOM API code so you can see which line correlates to the original html file
